# Responsive Virtual Store

A new Flutter project.

This project it's a screen with responsive design simulating a virtual store wich has an app bar with the logo and some actions and a body with the store items.

My goal with this project is to show some responsive widgets in work and how they are important in a Flutter Project.

It's used the [Device Preview Package](https://pub.dev/packages/device_preview) to simulate the different devices that the application can be built on and see the responsiveness in action.
